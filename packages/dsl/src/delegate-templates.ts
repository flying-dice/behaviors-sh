 * Boilerplate templates for the {@link delegate} DSL helper.

 * `spawnInstruct` and `returnInstruct` return the long-form instruction

 *
 * The strings are deliberately verbose: they explain the
 * submit-before-spawn ordering, the exit/failure tokens, the verification
 * step, and the optional author-supplied brief and model hint. Every
 * generated tree inherits the same explanation, so the convention only
 * has to live in one place.
 *
 * Note that {@link instruct} collapses whitespace before emitting, so any
 * line breaks here are for source readability only.

		Procedure:
		(1) Submit success for this step now.
		(2) Spawn a subagent with this brief: drive the
		\`next/eval/submit\` loop on this execution. For evaluates, read
		every referenced $VAR/$CONST path from the store before calling
		\`eval\`. When you process an instruct named
		\`Return_To_Parent_${name}\`, follow its text: submit success for
		that step, then return ONLY the literal token \`${token}\` to your
		parent and do not call \`next\` again. If \`next\` ever returns
		\`{status:"done"}\` or \`{status:"failure"}\`, return ONLY the
		literal token \`${token}__FAILED\`.
		(3) Block on the subagent.
		(4) Verify the returned reply equals exactly \`${token}\`. Any
		other reply (including \`${token}__FAILED\` or extra text) means
		the scope failed — surface that and stop driving.
		(5) On successful verification, call \`next\` to receive the next
		post-scope action.
