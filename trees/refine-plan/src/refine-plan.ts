			will be implemented — files, patterns, dependencies] ##
			Affected Systems [List of systems/modules/services touched]
			## Acceptance Criteria [Testable conditions that prove the
			change is complete] ## Risks & Considerations [Edge cases,
			backwards compatibility, performance, security] ## Open
			Questions [Anything unresolved that needs codeowner input]
